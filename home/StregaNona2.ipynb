      "First we know that when Strega Nona prepares pasta just for her and Big Anthony, the pot is \"full of steaming hot pasta.\"  Thus we know that the pot itself is actually not very big, producing enough pasta for two people.  Let's be generous, since this is an Italian story, and say that together they eat about **1 pound of pasta** -- this is the size of a typical box of spaghetti sold in American supermarkets, which is a bit more than I need for dinner for my family.  But, again, Big Anthony is *big*, and they *are Italian*. :)\n",

There is a Mayor, there is a Priest, there are \"the sisters of the convent\", there's Big Anthony and Strega Nona of course, and some number of regular townsfolk.  Tomie de Paola's artwork never shows more than 10 or 15 people at a time, but this seems to be too small for such a town.  Comparing to some demographics for [medieval European settlement](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/demog.htm demographics) we get a figure of about 100-300 for a \"village\" and 1000-8000 for a \"town\"  -- both of these seem too big given the artwork in the story, so I'll settle for the lower number of 100:"

The pot may indeed be magical, but Big Anthony is most certainly **not**.\n",
