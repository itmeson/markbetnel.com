Curating Insight

I've been noodling around for the last month or so about a reframing of how I see my intellectual task as a teacher.  I think it's about curating insight.

Dense bundles of connections between concepts and ideas and other insights the students already have and new things.  I've been getting a lot of a-ha moments this year, in both my math class and my two flavors of physics -- something I've not had as much of in the past few years because I wasn't really focused on getting them.  I've felt like a-ha moments are kind of empty because they don't translate into changed behaviors  or beliefs.

But maybe they can.  If the insights/connections gleaned are sufficiently dense, and if they are followed by opportunities to reflect, to practice, to speculate, and to plan....

I've never thought there was much point to teaching procedures.
