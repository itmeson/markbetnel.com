I coach my son's (Kid1.6's) soccer team, Under-7's.  Last night as we were leaving practice, he was carrying the water bottles and I was loaded down with the balls, the cones, and the coach bag, and he wanted to run to the car.  I didn't.

 Kid1.6:  Daddy!  Whoever gets to the car first, gets one gummi bear when we get home!

 Me: But I don't want to run.

 K: If we touch *at the same time* we **both** get one gummi bear!

 Me: Okay then!!

 (and we jog to the car and touch at the same time)

 K: Yeah!

 (we drive home, negotiate with Kid2.3 who wants us to look at her puzzle before we do anything else, then manage some time in the kitchen to deal with the gummi question without little sister seeing the candy right before bedtime.  I pull two gummis out of the bag, and offer to let him choose which one he wants.  He takes them both.)

 Me:  Hey!  That's not fair -- you agreed we'd each get one.

 K: NOOO.  I said we could have one each.  And "One" means 2.  So you can have 2 also.

 Me:  ....  That's *not* what you said before....  but I can go with it.  So "One" means 2 gummi bears.  What does "Two" mean?

 K: If you say "Two" then you get 1 gummi.

 Me: (smiling a little)  Okay.  Let's play a game then.  If I say "Twelve", how many should I get?

 K: Ummm.  I don't know.

 Me: Isn't "Twelve" a "one" and a "two"?

 K: Ummmm.  I don't want to do this.

 Me: (backpedaling, pushed too far to fast) Okay okay -- what if I say "Three"?  How many should I get then?

 K: (grinning) 0!!

 Me: What if I say "four"?

 K: 6!

 Me: Okay, wait.  Let me write this down.

(I get a whiteboard, and copy over the ones we've done already.  He leans on my shoulder and watches as I write)

 Me: Okay.  What about if I say "five"?

 K: 8!

(fill in rest of table up to 10.  He is trying to avoid repeats, but having troubled scanning the table to see what's used up already)

 Me: That is so cool.  Let's try this, suppose I got to eat 8 gummis, what number did I *say*?

 K: "Five"

 Me: (hidden, wicked grin) What if I got to eat 10 gummis?

 K: (without hesitation) You said either "seven" or "nine".

 Me: (surprised) Wow, really good job.  So you can definitely have "one" gummi.  Thanks for playing with me.

 (interlude, he eats 2 gummis.  We take the whiteboard to show Mama and Kid2.3.  Mama asks if she can have "four" gummis to share with Kid2.3.  Kid1.6 agrees and gets the gummis.  It's almost bath time and it's time to wrap it up)

 Me: (back in kitchen) Okay, that was really cool how you did that.  I've got one more question for you.  I'll bet you want more gummis.  What should you say to me so you can have as many gummis *total* as you gave to Mama and Kid2.3?

 K: (thinks for quite a while, staring at board) Can I have "one" gummi?  (pauses, grins) Can I have another "one" gummi?

 Me: Absolutely.  That was awesome. (I give him 4 more gummis)


That was so fun.
