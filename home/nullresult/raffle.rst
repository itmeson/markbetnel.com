My son's school does an awesome Market Day a couple of times per year -- early lessons in capitalism.  For two hours on a Friday afternoon, the whole school becomes a bazaar of kid crafts, kid buskers, kid capitalism, and kid shopping.  Most of them run little businesses, selling stuff to other kids or to parents who walk the halls.

Each kid starts out with $100.  If they've decided to run a business, they have to rent a table and a space for their shop.  If they want a high traffic site in the hallway, it costs more.  Lower traffic spots in the classrooms cost less.  If they need electricity, they have to pay for it.  Anything they sell has to have been made with their own labor, and any materials that go into it have to have been purchased by the kid.  Parents have to sign off verifying that every item in the kid's supply chain had some reasonable opportunity cost.

In the fall, G1.5 partnered with a friend to run "Loopty - Planes R Us", selling folded paper airplanes.  He made a 40% profit for the day, and got to keep the scrip money as seed for this time around.  His plan this week was to sell easter eggs (the store was called "Eggs - It" ), which he had decorated and filled with little toys and other things from his own stuff.  His opportunity cost was his time and giving up a bunch of his things.  He sold the eggs for $5, insisting that they had to be purchased unopened -- blind.

He also ran a raffle.  One big easter basket filled with eggs, with raffle tickets for $5.  Making the raffle tickets proved to be the most challenging part of the process for him.  He had to quickly make a whole bunch of tickets that could be torn 

Suppose there was a fixed number of raffle tickets available for purchase.  Each purchaser draws one ticket from a bowl at random, and immediately learns whether or not they have won.

**What is the best way to price the tickets?**
