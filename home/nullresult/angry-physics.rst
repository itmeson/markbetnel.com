I tried an interesting experiment in my 9th grade Labscience class last week.  I pointed the students at the Angry Physics site (http://ncase.me/birds) and asked them to play with it without talking or collaborating in any way.  I told them to "figure out the game".  If you haven't played it before, go do that now before you continue.

....


After about 5-10 minutes, when most of them were starting to think they had it figured out because they had noticed a sine curve forming in the graph, I announced that "Figuring it out means that you can fire and hit the pig *every single time* without ever missing."

(If you haven't figured it out yet, go back and do that)


....

So then over the next 10-15 minutes I walked around making sure they weren't talking to each other, and checked their work if they thought they had figured it out.  If they hit the pig three times in a row (and I could see that they were correctly using the green line and the red line and the red shading), I put a post-it on their computer so I could see who was finished.  

The existence of a badge of pride made the rest of them figure it out pretty quickly.  I occasionally gave a hint: "What does the green line mean?"

By the time there were only a couple students left, I announced "Okay, now it is okay to talk with your group about it.  Compare notes and find out whether you were using the same strategy or not."
