`Strega Nona`_ is a delightful story -- if you haven't, you should definitely
go read it.  Big Anthony, who "doesn't pay attention", takes a job working for
Strega Nona, the woman everyone in the village goes to for help with their
headaches and husbands and warts.  He cleans and takes care of the goat, and in
exchange gets food to eat and a place to sleep -- he thinks it's a very good
deal.

One evening, Big Anthony eavesdrops on Strega Nona, hearing her sing a little
song to her pasta pot, which is suddenly "filled with steaming hot pasta."
"How wonderful!" thinks Big Anthony -- "that's a magic pasta pot for sure!"  He
tells everyone in the village about the pot, but they laugh at him, saying he
should go confess to the priest after such a big lie.

This makes Big Anthony angry -- something G1.4 points out is "not a good thing
to be" -- sometimes being angry causes some bad choices.  Big Anthony vows to
prove them wrong.

Just days later, Strega Nona goes to visit her friend, Strega Amelia, leaving
Big Anthony to take care of things while she is gone, and he takes the
opportunity to try out the pasta pot for himself.  Unfortunately, Big Anthony
missed a crucial detail in the song that causes the pot to *stop* making pasta
-- leading to a classic Sorcerer's Apprentice episode.

First Big Anthony sings the song to produce pasta, and the pot is "instantly
filled with steaming hot pasta" -- so he quickly runs down to the village to
tell everyone to gather "forks and spoons and platters and bowls -- pasta for
all at Strega Nona's house!"

Everyone comes running (with forks and platters and bowls), expecting to have
another chance to laugh at Big Anthony, but they are shocked to find pasta
beginning to spill out of the pot and onto the floor.  Big Anthony works
quickly, serving all the villagers (even the priest and the sisters of the
convent!) with some coming back for seconds.  

Everyone is gathered around to congratulate Big Anthony when one of the sisters
of the convent notices that pasta is beginning to spill out the doors of the
cottage.  Big Anthony runs inside, shouting the song to stop the pasta pot, but
still missing the crucial detail (blowing a kiss to the pot at the end).  One
of the villagers pulls Big Anthony out of the cottage only just in time to save
him from being smothered by the pasta, which has by now filled the entire
cottage.

Within minutes, a wall of pasta is descending the hill toward the village, and the 
people are running for their lives.  Of course, Strega Nona returns just in time
to prevent the pasta from entirely engulfing the village and Big Anthony is 
required to eat all the pasta to clean up the mess.

This week, the questions, and over the next week or so, some thoughts on answers and
further questions:

**1. How much pasta is that?**

**2. What is the pasta pot's peak production rate?**

**3. How many calories must Big Anthony eat to clean up the mess?**

**4. How much energy must the pot use to produce all that steaming hot pasta?**

**5. What other questions does the story raise?**
