March for our Lives

I'm not marching today, because my foot is injured and I can't do the whole route.  Also my daughter (K2.5) didn't feel like going at the last moment, so we're hanging out this morning, while my wife and son (K1.8) go to the march.  I'm proud of my kids and my family being super engaged, in a lot of things, from supporting de-escalation training for the police to gun reform to support for public education.

I'm also proud of my students who didn't come to class during the Walkout.

Since I can't march today, I feel like I need to make some kind of public statement about it -- I used to think that the purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to codify a right of rebellion against tyranny, and I supported that.  But two things have changed that (1) realizing that some of the intent of the second amendment was actually about arming slave-catching patrols, and (2) seeing the carnage of crime, suicide, and mass killings over and over and over again, while realizing that with a modern military, it really doesn't matter what small arms are available to the population -- the rebellion will lose.

Also, I don't think anyone *needs* lethal weapons. I'd like to see regular police not carrying lethal weapons and I'd like to convince everyone else that they don't need them either.  Whatever you think you need to own a lethal weapon for, I'd like to acquire the evidence to convince you it isn't really helping, or that the other costs are too high to justify owning it.

I'm not talking about taking them away, and neither are most of the people marching today.  They are talking about limitations that will decrease the carnage.
