We've been visiting some friends for our midwinter break, who live in a cohousing development in Oregon.  They have a lifestyle we (my wife and I) are really jealous of.  It's a multi-generational community that shares some common resources and tasks while living in single family apartments or townhomes, on a largish parcel of property.  As consumed as we are by kid-stuff right now, the apparent ease with which the parents in the community are able to set their kids out into the safety of the property, is, by itself, enough to recommend this arrangement.  But the way the community works together to handle shared tasks and problems is really remarkable -- it reminds us both a lot of our process in a Quaker Meeting for Business, except that most of the issues faced in a Quaker Meeting for Business are either mundane or abstract, and thus don't usually lead to real rancor.

But even simple issues, when faced by a community that is forced to *live together*, take on a lot of weight and baggage.  So the community has, for years, been practicing strategies of non-violent communication as a way to help everyone continue to make progress even when they don't agree.  I plan to take a deeper look at the specific strategies they've been using, but one in particular struck me -- one of my friends commented that when they make a decision, they don't just record what the decision was -- they record the priorities and feelings and emotions that were brought up during the decision process too.  That way, if they later find that the decision has to be changed, they can make a new decision that respects all the priorities and feelings that were already identified.  (Plans often have to change once construction starts, and having to rehash all the process in order to decide what to do with an obstacle can derail the entire endeavor).

I've been thinking about process and result a lot in my teaching.  Education, and specifically math and science education, tend to focus on the results, leaving out a lot of the process.  Did you get the problem right?  What is the definition of "momentum"?  Can you apply this algorithm to a new situation?

My teaching tends to focus on process, sometimes to the exclusion of results.  And that's hard for students to follow.  I'm wondering if our lizard-brains prefer results over reasons, because results can be applied quickly when faced with the same situation in the future.  Compare, "RUN!  That's dangerous!" to "I have observed in the past that holes that look like that often contain snakes.  Snakes are dangerous.  Therefore, RUN!"

So how does one teach (or learn) in a way that respects the need for results as an end in themselves; the need for results as an epistemological shortcut for future, similar situations; the reasons that lead to those results; and the thinking process, chain of evidence, rules of inference that lead to those results.

Is what I want to teach results?  Or evidence?  Or new rules of inference?

Popular science teaches the results and the feeling of understanding without really enabling the learner to do anything they couldn't do before.

Formal education tends to focus on efficiency.  Learning the most efficient way to achieve a pre-defined result, without really learning how to start from scratch, how to transfer knowledge and skills to truly novel situations, and often without knowing any of the reasons why the efficient methods word or *when* they work.

I've been focused on a fuzzy knowing why and when but mostly achieving the "feeling" of mathematical reasoning.

But I haven't yet learned how to help anyone master anything.  My soccer coaching is fuzzy.  My math and physics teaching are fuzzy.

How do I continue to make students feel successful while learning how to help the ones who want it to excel?  

How do I help them to encode for future use and transfer both the results and the reasoning?
