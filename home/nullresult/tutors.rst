Being a tutor pissed me off.

I used to be a tutor, almost full-time.  I've worked for big test-prep companies, and I've worked freelance.  I've worked on academic support, enrichment, and test preparation.  I paid for a solid chunk of my master's degree in philosophy through tutoring, and just about all of my wife's and my spending money when we were at BU.

And it always bugged me.  

At its best, tutoring is what the teaching relationship ought to be, if we could afford it.  One-on-one.  Focused.  Timely.  Personal.  Etc.   And I really enjoyed that part.  It really is all about the individual student when you are tutoring.

But in most cases, a tutor is there to support *someone else's goals*.  Usually the student's teacher or the test (SAT and MCAT are the two big ones I'ved worked with), sometimes the student's parents.  Not as often the student themself.

I always tried to make it about the student's goals, but even then, those goals were usually defined solely by the parameters of the class they were in or the test they were preparing for.  If what they needed to pass the test was to memorize some formulas and get help in memorizing the problem types on which to apply them -- that's all they wanted me to do, and just about all I could get away with. 

I have some strong, research-supported, opinions about physics education, but I never got to use any of them as a tutor because the students just wanted me to help them get through the homework and memorize the formulas, because that's all they needed to care about.

I have a lot of experience in math education, but tutoring students always want you to walk them through the homework.

This works because 



What am I really trying to say here?  I'm trying to say that I hate tutors.  I hate them.  I despise the way they prey on weak students and their families, promising them better grades, less stress, and higher standardized test scores without addressing the underlying issues.  The student is in school full-time already, and the school should be setup to support most of the students most of the time without the need for extra support.  If they do need extra support, it should be temporary, focusing on underlying issues so the tutor works themselves out of a job quickly.

If that is what the tutor is doing, then they shouldn't need incredible detail about what the class is doing, because their job isn't to "get the student through the class", but to help them think better so they can support themselves.  

But that is not how it seems to work.  I've got students who have permanent extra tutors



What should tutoring be?  If it's long term, it should be focused on general skills




Why am I writing this?  Because tutors are a pain in my ass and I want them to go away.  So I need to develop a general theory of tutoring so I can figure out how to use them effectively to support my students, without creating a ton of extra work for me, since they don't seem to be going away any time soon.
