I'm Mark Betnel, a high school teacher, physicist, programmer, and philosopher.  I live and work in Seattle with my wife Sara and our two children, who are *awesome*.

I have a curriculum vitae (cvpdf_ ) and I'm interested in finding cool projects to work on in my spare time.  My current projects include developing mixed media teaching materials for math and science classes, a popular-level book about understanding scientific and mathematical principles through children's literature, and exploring the world with my kids.
