1. Is the formula $(x+5)^2 = x^2 + 25$ always true?  If it is, find a way to prove that it is true.  If it is not, provide a counterexample (a value of $x$ which shows that the formula is not always true).
  

2. Write down all the subsets of the following sets:

   a. $\\{a,b,c\\}$
   b. $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$

3. Write down something you notice about the lists of subsets in 2.
