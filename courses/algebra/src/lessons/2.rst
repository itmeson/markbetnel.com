1. Representations of multiplication -- repeated addition is a good model of multiplication when you have whole numbers, but it gets more and more problematic as you begin to deal with non-whole numbers and numbers with negative sign.

2. People used to represent numbers as geometric figures made out of dots -- very cool, as long as you don't try to multiply them, or interpret them for negative numbers.

3. The "obvious" properties of numbers (closure, associativity, commutativity) are not actually that obvious.
