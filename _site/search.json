That committment led me to study physics and literature as an undergraduate, then to teach high school and go to graduate school in philosophy where I wrote about moral agency and propaganda. Then when I went back to grad school again, in physics, I chose research projects that were funded outside the defense ecosystem, and focused on my teaching practice and my young family (spouse and newborn).\nAfter my defense, I got a teaching job at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, where I had a very busy two years that included the birth of our second child and teaching eleven different preps in 6 terms of teaching, out of two different departments.\nMy wife and I made a difficult choice to leave Rhode Island to move to Seattle so our kids could grow up near their grandparents and cousins, and I took a job at a private high school in Seattle. I’m now in my tenth year in that job, and have taught courses in three departments, created a number of new classes, and helped to develop and launch a new department to offer courses in computational thinking. I am most proud of increasing enrollment and diversity in our senior physics elective, and of the course I created on the technical and ethical implications of machine learning.\nOutside of my main job, I also teach a night course at a local community college, coach youth soccer teams for my kids, am an active member of a Quaker meeting, and I work on writing/education about the uses and implications of technology and issues in education."

    "text": "There are so many questions begged there that I really don’t know where to start.\nI’ve been getting a lot from Dan Meyer’s takes on generative AI for math teaching and on Jane Rosenzweig’s thoughts about generative AI and writing. Rosenzweig points out that friction is actually what you need, “I don’t assign summary and analysis because I need the output. I assgin these steps because I want to help my students think through complex ideas and grapple with them.”\nAlong with all these ed-tech launches and promotion, there’s also a lot of learning materials being put out there for teachers – to help them understand AI and how to use it in their classes. There’s some good stuff in these. They do walk teachers through prompt writing and refinement, they talk realistically about capabilities and limitations, and they dutifully point out issues with “hallucinations, bias, and privacy” (though they never quite say what they mean by those.)\nStudents don’t particularly care about privacy, and hallucinations are (possibly) a temporary issue. Bias is probably here to stay, but it’s not an issue that stops most people from using a tool, and it certainly doesn’t stop students.\nBut these are not the most important issue with generative AI and education – the most important question, that the ed-tech promoters and the professional development purveyors seem intent on avoiding, is what Joy Buolamwini calls the “apprentice gap” Unmasking AI and what Rosenzweig is talking about when she points to the value of friction. Education is about the development of personal skills and knowledge. It’s about empowerment and freedom. And the motivation to achieve those usually comes through struggle. The real question, the one that remains even if all the current issues with bias, hallucination, and privacy are “fixed”, is how educators can continue to guide students toward empowerment and freedom when students are carrying a tool that removes all the moments of friction that would motivate them to build those skills and knowledge? How do they move from dependence to apprenticeship to expertise when the tools will just make every product for them?\nThe issues we need to grapple with are about whether there are any skills or knowledge that students really do need to have in their own heads, what those are, and how to build them both with and without these tools available. Any ed-tech product and any teacher PD that doesn’t wrestle with that issue is begging the most important question."

    "text": "If I map the allegory onto language, then my thoughts are the “real” objects, and the words I produce are the light that carries the signal about those thoughts to others, who, on hearing the shadow-words, construct theories about the real thoughts that produced them. When they respond with words of their own, casting shadow puppets back to me, I form theories about the thoughts that produced them, and thus refine my own thoughts.\nOne use of large language models (LLMs) is to facilitate communication, by taking over some of the work of composing the text that I might send to someone else. This is introducing another layer of translation into my system of shadow words – I have a thought I wish to communicate (or a topic I wish to communicate about), so I compose a prompt for the LLM. The LLM produces text that matches the prompt. If I am careful, I will edit the result – thus getting one layer of feedback about my thoughts, causing me to refine those thoughts. The produced message will not be precisely what I intended (it never is and never has been), but I will send it anyway as it’s close enough. The receiver won’t read the message, it will be too long, and anyway, they will know that it was produced by an LLM not by me, so there’s no insult in feeding the message into their own LLM. The receiver’s LLM will interpret the result and possibly summarize it for the receiver, who will form theories about the mind that produced the text before responding. Or perhaps the receiving LLM will skip that step and just compose the reply. Either way, I will receive a reply that is mediated by one or more translations through another LLM, finally causing me to update my own thoughts based on the feedback.\nAre there instances where these extra layers will enable communication with greater fidelity? Probably. Will there be instances where the layers introduce more noise? Or steer my thoughts? Certainly. And if I don’t control the intermediary LLMs, how can I be sure that the steering isn’t intended to manipulate me, the way every other algorithmic communication system has been dual purposed for manipulation?\nIn the allegory, the philosopher is supposed to fight to get free of the cave and then fight to free everyone else. LLMs are more like adding a series of mirrors and lenses in between the shadow puppet casters and the trapped humans instead."

    "text": "That’s how it feels to me when I am trying to connect ideas to illuminate an important point as a teacher, or to convince my readers in an essay – I can’t quite find the connection, the pieces I’m trying to connect are buffeted about randomly. As I sit down to write, there are many different ways I might connect up those ideas, some of which might be helpful, and some of which might be true. But I might connect them up in true ways that are not illuminating, or I could light on a misleading explanation that causes the very misconceptions I was trying to avoid.\nWriting is like a careful crystallization process. Water is slowly removed. Some of those sodium and chlorine ions find each other again, lining up to form solid bonds once more. As the first ions line up, others happen to find their way into place in the same ordered structure, continuing a pattern of sodium to chlorine to sodium to chlorine, over and over again, building left and right, forward and backward, and up and down in a beautiful solid lattice. Just so the words I write, if I am careful, guide the next words into the right place as the idea that was half formed in my head crystallizes into a clarity.\nBut if the process is too fast or the conditions not quite right, the sodium and chlorine atoms leave gaps in the pattern, or start growing their patterns from more than one starting location, so the final result has imperfections or pieces that grow together at strange angles that cannot continue the pattern. The resulting salt crystals have their own beauty, but the writing produced lacks the clarity of purpose that I sought for, my readers aren’t convinced by my arguments, and my students are left confused.\nTo guard against this, I read my own words as I write. The already produced text guides my thinking, achieving clarity in my head through iteration between the mental maelstrom, the malleable words as I edit, and the fixed words in the completed product. I learn as much from this process as any of my future readers will.\nThe written word is the crystallization of incomplete thoughts into a form that helps the writer develop their own ideas AND communicate them to others.\nDoes Generative AI have a place in this process?\nMy fear is that generative AI will produce complete crystals all at once, without the feedback between writer and written word that underlies traditional writing. How easy will it be for the writer to convince themselves that, “yes, those words were the ones I meant to say”? “That is the idea I had half-formed in my head, now expressed perfectly.” If the generative AI does in fact produce and crystallize the right idea, then maybe this is a good thing. But if the AI system steers the writer toward a different crystal, one that isn’t quite the same, will the writer ever discover what they really thought, for themself? Whose thought will it be?\nSome will respond that it doesn’t matter. If the writing produced by the AI system is better than my own, I might as well use it. I think anyone who would say this must see a different instrumental value in writing than I do. I think they see the product and the influence it will have on the reader as the point. I see the process, and the influence it has on me, as the primary point, with the effect on future readers as a wonderful bonus that I have no right to expect.\nBut also, I fear the world in which the process relationship between the writer and the written product is broken and replaced by generative AI, as I see no reason at that point for a human to read the product either. Wouldn’t they just use their own “reader AI” to summarize the result for them? They certainly wouldn’t be insulting my craft to do so.\nIt doesn’t seem such a big step, to me, to cut the humans out of this loop entirely, and then what have we gained? What does it profit a human, to gain the world, without also understanding it?"

    "text": "There’s obviously a tension. Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers express a similar-sounding view, “I’m just doing my own research, and I don’t think these vaccines are safe,” they say, arguing that they should get to decide for themselves. When decisions truly only affect the individual, I’m content to leave it as an individual decision. But public health affects everyone, so there has to be room for experts to inform the public about the technical issues, and room for political processes to decide how to use that information in making recommendations and rules. Technical expertise informs technical questions, and the answer to those technical questions inform critical reflection and judgement. Importantly, it’s not just the opinions of vaccine developers which count for the technical questions – there’s an FDA whose purpose is to insure that the vaccines are safe AND effective.\n\n\n\n(Tweet from Yann LeCun.)\n\n\nYann LeCun thinks that builders of AI are the only ones whose opinion really counts. They aren’t afraid of AGI, so the rest of us shouldn’t be either.\nFirst, that’s not true – there are a number of people who work at the cutting edge of AI research and development who are worried about the potential harms of AGI (and at least as importantly, who worry about the actual current harms from irresponsible deployment of AI tools). But I think that’s a red herring anyway, as the relevant expertise here isn’t technical.\nThe only technical insight one needs is that AI systems are developed in a way to maximize their “score” on measurements of how well their outputs reflect the programmers’ goals. If the score measurement perfectly reflects the engineered goals (and those goals are good ones), then there isn’t a problem. But the score measurement never perfectly reflects the engineered goals. I’ve tried to measure student learning in many different ways in my career, but I’ve never managed to find a way to do that that prevented students from “gaming” the system. There always seems to be a way to get a good score without actually learning, and some students always seem to find it.\nMachine learning systems are also quite creative at gaming their scoring systems, allowing them to get good scores without actually doing the thing we wanted them to do. Some examples of this are just funny. Some are pretty disturbing. The point, for those of us who are worried but aren’t cutting edge AI researchers like Yan LeCun, is that engineered products are supposed to satisfy relevant safety guidelines. Pharmaceutical companies have to demonstrate that their products are safe and effective before they can be used. But there isn’t an FDA for algorithms (yet), and if the only opinions that matter are those of the developers, we’re stuck trusting folks who are motivated more by the potential profit than by the relevant ethical questions, and even then those experts don’t really know how safe and effective their products are.\nSo absent any independent assurances, my questions and expertise are just as relevant as LeCun’s. I think that attacking the “information space” with a misinformation bomb is a problem. Deploying automated decision making tools without taking legal responsibility for the outcomes is a problem. Moving fast and breaking the education system with a tool that subverts our entire assessment framework is a problem. There’s of course many more – all of which are going to require some solutions or mitigations or just deciding not to do that.\nIt would be great if the leaders in developing these tools also seemed to be interested in collaborating with the rest of us to figure out which tools might be useful, which need safeguards, and which shouldn’t be used at all. In figuring out what we ought to do, GPT is definitely not all you need."

It was intimidating.\nThe problem poser and a third teacher who had seen the problem before but didn’t remember the solution were looking over my shoulder while I was sketching and thinking.\nSo intimidating\nI found myself falling prey to all the mental traps I see my students fall into.\n“It’s taking too long. I must have missed something.”\n“Are they going to respect me if I can’t figure it out?”\n“This approach looks promising, but it doesn’t seem elegant enough to justify the problem-poser’s satisfaction.”\n“Maybe I should make a new drawing. This one isn’t very neat.”\nand the third teacher, who half-remembered having done the problem before, admitted that he was falling prey to the trap of trying to remember the solution, rather than thinking afresh about it (one of the more common traps my students fall into).\nSo I’m taking away from this a reminder of how important it is to make the space safe for a student to experiment, and how easy it is to screw it up by asking the wrong question at the wrong time in the wrong way. Or even just by hovering a little too soon.\nI’m reminded of Feynman’s anecdote about the high school students he had working for him at Los Alamos near the end of the Manhattan Project. They had come up with a clever way to speed up their calculations, but they were still working out the bugs when he walked in the room, and, embarrased and worried that he would screw them up, they shouted at him to get out.\nI think Feynman is a problematic figure in science, but we could all think about following this one example at least, if we really want our students to feel safe: without a word, he closed the door and walked away."

    "text": "This class, being an elective, means at my school that I can’t assign (much) homework. It having no pre-requisites means I can count on no background knowledge about computing. This is by design, as I want everyone in the school to take the class. I’m getting about 80 kids per year in it, so maybe 50% of the school will have taken it at some point – I feel good about that. But that still means it’s challenging to teach.\nWhat I want is for them to come away with an informed curiousity about the technology and its implications, so they can ask good questions about it and make good decisions about it in their own lives and for society. That’s a good goal, but it’s kind of nebulous for defining the performances I want them to be capable of during the class. What ends up happening is a bunch of reading, playing with little toy examples, and discussions that are a little one-sided – I have a lot to learn about how to teach a class like this.\nSo one of the concret-ish things I want from them is to understand the workflow of supervised learning and deployment: data gathering, curation, and labelling; model training; model testing; deployment; maintenance; end-user usage; iteration. With each of those steps I want them to know a little technical detail and to think about some of the fraught questions that can arise (and that they should ask!)\nFor example: Why do we need an ML tool for this task? Is it plausible that there is signal in the available data to power the ML tool? If the desired tool really works exactly as designed, does it pass the “Is it creepy?” test? What are the broader implications of success or failure with the project? Where does the data come from? How does it get labelled? How is privacy of data subjects protected? Is informed consent obtained? What are the training costs and issues? What does it mean to overfit vs underfit? How does one test the results? What are the error rates? Is there more than one kind of error? Do the different kinds of errors have costs (for the user and the target)? Do the errors (and successes) fall on population subgroups equitably? How is the model used in deployment? How is the performance monitored once deployed? Are there plans to maintain the system and to bring it down if results are not as expected? What would the next generation tool look like? Will it be more data, better labelling, more training compute, more sophisticated testing, better deployment infrastructure, better user education…\nThat’s a lot of questions. I asked the students this week to make a flowchart of what they thought the steps were – as a kind of formative assessment for me of what ideas had landed and which hadn’t. One thing I noticed is that a lot of them went straight from “Identify problem” to “Train computer to solve problem” without any kind of “acquire labelled data” step – that’s definitely a step that I thought we’d spent enough time discussing, so I was thinking about finding a demo of how labelling works – something like the workflow of a Mechanical Turk-er, and then present some stats on the quality of the labelling so they can think about issues of reliability of the labels, the effect of the labels on the training process, and how well the data set covers the relevant universe of things. I couldn’t find anything like that.\nSo I’ve been trying to make it. Progress reports to follow, but it turns out that I’ve never done server side programming before, and it’s a fine rabbit hole."

It’s going great – much better than he has a right to expect on his first try, when he sees a moose in his path ahead. The moose is completely unaware of Mr. Magee, it’s fixated on a tasty looking tree on the other side of a chasm in the snow, and wondering how to get across.\nMr. Magee meanwhile is shouting for the moose to move because he doesn’t know how to steer, when he suddenly leans back and slides on his butt, under the moose, catching the tips of the skis on a log. He then flips entirely upside down, landing with the back of the skis on the other side of the chasm, the front tips lodged under the log on the uphill side of the chasm, and he, poor Mr. Magee, is hanging upside down from the skis!\nThen the moose turns around.\nWondering where Mr. Magee had gone, the moose does see a bridge, built just for him, across the chasm, and begins to walk across on top of the skis.\nThe skis bend, but do not break, when the moose looks down to see Mr. Magee starting up at him in terror. So of course the moose jumps in fright, pushing Mr. Magee down some more, but landing safely on the downhill side where he can go eat that tasty tree.\nMr. Magee on the other hand, is sproinged up in the air, flips right side up, and lands safely on his skis on the uphill side of the chasm!!\nSo of course Mr. Magee goes home and puts his skis to a better use for a while.\nWith this story I’m seeing a physics lesson, centered around rotational motion, forces, and elastic stretches.\nSome possible questions:\n\nHow much does the snow compress under the tip and back of the skis when Mr. Magee flips over? How much more does it compress when the moose steps on him?\nCan we infer the elastic properties of the skis from how much they stretch when Mr. Magee is hanging upside down?\nWhat are all the interactions and forces while the moose is jumping off the skis? How might this cause Mr. Magee to get flipped right side up?\nIs moose going forward and Magee going backward an example of “equal and opposite”?\nHow strong must the log-fulcrum be to cause Magee to flip upside down? How fast must the rotational motion be?\n\nMy possible questions from this story are a lot more “physics teacher-y” than some of the other stories I’m thinking about, but they’re a lot of fun and might lead to some cool modelling opportunities.\nThe Skiing Magee is a part of a planned series of posts analyzing mathematical, computational, and scientific themes in children’s stories as part of possibly writing a book playing some fun games with these stories."

Sure there’s a few people who are convinced that their kid is going to be the one, and a few kids who are convinced by the dream. And a few of them actually do make it. But the reason we do it must be about something other than the future financial payoff.\nThe reasons we’ll say tend to be about fitness, teamwork, leadership, tactical thinking, and culture. Of course, if it was just about fitness, we’d probably be doing a lot more gymnastics and weights – individual sports. But team sports are more fun. And it’s easier to share them with spectators.\nAnd I think all of those are great reasons to get kids into sports, even if none of them become professionals.\nSo how many kids learn math every year? All of them? To a first approximation.\nAnd how many of those kids ever get paid to do math? Well, it’s not none of them this time. In fact, I think most people do use some mathematical thinking in their work. But the number who get paid to really do math? Not very many. So why do we put kids into math?\nHow many kids learn intellectual skills every year? All of them?\nAnd how many will ever “turn pro” as an intellectual? Arguably, all of them, if you have a broad understanding of what intellectual skills are and how they are used.\nWhat about in the near future, when ubiquitous AGI does most of the intellectual work that needs doing? Will there be a time when a small group of elite professional intellectuals are the only ones who’ve survived the gauntlet of the minor leagues of high school, college, and graduate school to get to turn pro? Will they have an NFL career (not-for-long) while they are still able to keep up with the best of the best, before they inevitably slow down and have to settle into a long retirement telling stories of their glory days developing new theorems?\nWill it still be worth teaching those intellectual skills to most or all students, even though only a tiny fraction will ever need to use them?"
