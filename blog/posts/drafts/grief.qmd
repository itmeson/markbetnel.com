Tender.

A couple lying in a too-small bed. 
She is on her side, hands cradling his face.
Breathing.

Their children and friends
quickly leave the room
close the door.

Breathe.

Exit the elevator together,
move to hotel rooms across
the street.

Go to sleep.

Breathe.

He's not waking up!

that was what we expected (what did you *expect*?)

Gather in the too-small room.
Soft voices at first, 
stories, laughter, hugs, handshakes,

thank you so much for coming
I'm sorry we couldn't get here yesterday
it means so much to have you here

Slowly leave the room
Close the door.
Breathe.
